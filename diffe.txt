window Object:

The window object is the top-level object in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy.
It represents the browser window or tab and provides access to various properties and methods for controlling and interacting with the window and its content.
You can access properties like window.location for the current URL, window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight for the viewport dimensions, and more.
It provides global functions, such as setTimeout and setInterval, for handling asynchronous operations.
You can also access the document object from the window, as window.document or simply document.
screen Object:

The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor and provides information about the user's display properties.
It offers properties like screen.width and screen.height to get the screen's resolution, screen.availWidth and screen.availHeight to get the available screen space (excluding taskbars), and screen.colorDepth for color depth.
You can use the screen object to adapt the content or layout of your web page based on the user's screen size and capabilities.
document Object:

The document object represents the content of the current web page and is a part of the DOM.
It allows you to access and manipulate the structure and content of the HTML document.
You can access elements within the document using methods like getElementById, querySelector, or getElementsByTagName.
It provides access to events and allows you to create, modify, or delete elements within the page.
The document object is mainly used for client-side scripting, such as handling user interactions, updating the content, and working with the Document Object Model.
